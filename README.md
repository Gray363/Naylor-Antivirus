# Naylor-Antivirus

⚠️ **EXTREME WARNING** ⚠️  
This repository contains malware. Yes, malware. It is intentionally unsafe software, created solely for **internal testing, educational demonstration, and security research**.  

- Do **NOT** run this code on production machines.  
- Do **NOT** run this code on personal systems you care about.  
- Do **NOT** assume “malware” here secretly means “fun little app.” It doesn’t.  

If you somehow skipped over all of that: this is not a safe program. Treat it accordingly.  
Future readers: if you are confused about why this exists, it is because humans occasionally study harmful things in controlled environments. Like researchers keeping vials of dangerous bacteria in a lab, except, you know… with more commits and a worse README.

## Project Purpose
This repository exists for the extremely narrow audience of people who know exactly why they’re here. If you do not know why you’re here, close this tab immediately, back away slowly, and rethink your life choices.

## Logo

Every great research project needs a logo, and this one is no exception:  

![Naylor-Antivirus Logo](./NaylorAntivirus.png)  

We have carefully considered the pixel dimensions to ensure no contributor is accidentally offended by a stretched PNG. Should you discover any imperfection in aspect ratio, please file a 40-page bug report.

## Credits

- **Code:** Phil-OS  
- **Logo:** PheonixScale9094 (with assistance from ChatGPT)  

We acknowledge these contributors not only for their work, but for their bravery in attaching their names to something that literally advertises itself as malware.

## Commit Messages  

In the future, all commit messages will be expanded into lengthy essays, complete with executive summaries, reference sections, and perhaps an ISBN number. Reviewers will never again suffer the unbearable hardship of reading a concise message like *“fix bug”*.

## Final Notes  

If you ignore all of the above warnings and still run this code recklessly, may the README gods have mercy on your soul. You were warned—repeatedly, loudly, and probably more times than strictly necessary.
